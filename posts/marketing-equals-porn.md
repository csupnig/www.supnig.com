So what do these two have in common? To answer this question I first have to talk about the nature of the every day love story. In those movies you always?get some kind of introduction where the characters get to know each other and build up tension to finally reach the climax of the movie. Then there is just the end and the?story is over. With porn, and I'm sure you have seen one, it is a bit different. Read more about this close relationship and find out what happened at the "meshed3" in Linz.

A porno mainly consists of a sequence of quick numbers, each searching to be a highlight of the movie and this is exactly what we want to create for our brands. We want to tell stories each of which being a highlight on its own but still following a consistent pattern to create a high value of recognition and familiarity.

[Christian Bluemelhuber](http://www.bluemelhuber.de/) also talked about the fact that marketing mainly consists of being on the right spot at the right time. 
![Meshed#3 in Linz](/media/pictures/meshed_small.jpg)As one cannot plan luck, the best way to go is again to copy nature and do it like sperm. Do lots of campaigns, try different ideas, iterate on the ones that work and cut off the ones that do not. This way you have a high probability of hitting the right spot.

There is a number of best practices to reach your customers:

*   **Be interesting**
Lets face it: Marketing is boring. Every day we get flooded with images and stories and our brain filters out all that does not seem to be important to us. 
*   **Don't always talk about yourself**
People are not interested whether you just bought a new car or are on the way to the cinema. They want to hear news and read articles that concern them.
*   **Make it possible to shine**
Give your readers the chance to be smart and they will love to discuss almost every topic.
*   **Talk when others are quiet**
We are surrounded with a lot of noise, get hundreds of emails each day and read even more tweets. In order to break through it is best to talk when every body else is quiet. Try to send your news on weekends and you will probably have a higher rate of conversion. 
*   **Use calls to action**
Asking people for their opinion or simply tell them to spread the news really works.

Writing about all these methods, I still have to provide the probably most important advice:  don't take everything for granted and try out what works best for you!
