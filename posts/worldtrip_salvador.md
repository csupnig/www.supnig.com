First we only wanted to stay for one night, but we decided otherwise.

## Staying in Salvador
After the last day with the other boys, Philippe and Me wanted to continue our way north to Penedo, but decided to stay two more nights in Salvador
and make a day trip from there.
We had been told that Salvador is even more dangerous than Rio but when we went to stroll around the old city in the evening, we only found
nice people. We even got invited for dinner by a few families sitting outside on the street on plastic chairs, watching a soccer game on the
TV they had pulled out.
In Salvador I also had the chance to meet Paolo, the friendly and weird reception guy at the Terra Nossa Pousada. He was one of the few guys
in Salvador who could speak english and he tried to help us wherever he could.
