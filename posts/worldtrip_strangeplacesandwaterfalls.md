Almost every day we are hiking through the jungle to visit all those different little rivers and waterfalls.

## Slowing things down
When I started my trip I was still trapped in that work, eat, sleep rhythm, that would constantly keep me at edge and left
now place to slow things down. Now that I am here and have the time to just look into the world around me, I feel that things
are finally slowing down and I am more relaxed. Every other day we start right after breakfast to hike in the area around Capao
and check out all those little creeks and rivers. There are places that remind me of other worlds that have long been without
human interference. The days we are not hiking, we spend reading, sleeping and looking with our eyes into the world around us :)
