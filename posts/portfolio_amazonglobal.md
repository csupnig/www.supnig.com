This website emerged out of my own need to create amazon partner links to products that are valid globally. It redirects
visitors to the desired product on their closest amazon store.

**Role:** Website developer

**Technology:** NodeJS, npm, Express, AWS

This little tool website helps me to globally link to amazon products without posting multiple links for each amazon store
 in different countries. If a visitor is located in the states he will be sent to amazon.com, if he is locaed in Austria,
 he will be sent to amazon.de and so on. Give it a try for your product links: [https://www.amazon-global.io/](https://www.amazon-global.io/)!
