When we at appointmed started out designing our application we were evaluating a few options for our technology stack.
Find out why we stuck with a combination of Angular and TypeScript and got to love it.

##Supercharge your frontend
When we at [appointmed](http://www.appointmed.com/) started out designing our application it pretty soon became clear that we would be using
AngularJS as our frontend framework. Since I am a rather lazy programmer, I like structure and maintainability wherever possible and
I want to take advantage of tools that help me to produce clean and understandable code.

I've had a look at TypeScript before when it was still very beta and still had lots of problems. But when we started out one of our team
members reintroduced me to TypeScript when it was at version 0.9.1.0. The idea of writing structured, object oriented code as I was used
to it from other languages gave me goose bumps of excitement.
