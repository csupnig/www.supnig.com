I just arrived back home in my beloved little place in Austria, called Vienna.

## Why I love to be back home
The last couple of weeks were a unique and very exciting experience for me where I got to know a ton of interesting and kind people,
pushed the limits of my comfort zone and learned a lot about myself. In fact the time was filled with such a huge multitude of amazing
events that I feel kind of full and satisfied now and this is also why I need some time to digest all these impressions.
Being back in Vienna, I am very much looking forward to see all my family and friends again and hear about all the things that
happened while I was out and about.

## The urge that is growing in my fingers
When I was listening to some talks at the squares conference in Texas, I got this huge inspiration that made my fingers itch to
work again and build something awesome. This is what I love about my profession, it always gets back to me, excites and inspires
me to do new projects.

## The journey is not over
Being back home I cannot stop thinking about the next destinations and places I want to travel to and this is why I have to keep
on going and went to Prague right away. I definitely look forward to traveling to further destinations again and in the meantime
I enjoy this lovely little place in Austria that I call my home.

To all the friends that I got to know during my trip: I loved spending time with every single one of you and I hope to see you
again some time!
