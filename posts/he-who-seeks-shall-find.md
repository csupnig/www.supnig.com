Once upon a time there was a happy customer; he usually spent some afternoons browsing shops before he bought new clothes. One beautiful day a friend came up to him and asked: "Why don't you buy online and save the time for fun stuff?" Curious, our little friend went home and switched on his computer. Eagerly he clicked through his collection of URLs to find a site where he could start his shopping spree. He was quite frustrated when he had spent hours in front of his screen not having seen a single piece of clothing. "Why should I buy online when I cannot even find a single shop?" he said to himself. Luckily he was a programmer and so he decided to code something that would allow him to search the whole internet for stuff he might like and that is how Google was born.
