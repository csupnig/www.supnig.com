A stormy and hot boat trip to the Ihla Grande.

## Overcoming language barriers
When I decided to do the Ihla Grande day trip, I wanted to meet other people who were visiting Rio and talk to them about
there experiences in this city. In the first minutes on the bus I was a bit disappointed, when I found out that I was the
one english speaking person on this trip. When we boarded the boat soon after, all the disappointment faded when I started
to talk to the people around me. The little portuguese, that I know by now, got me started and communicating with the Google
Translator did the rest. It seems so easy to get to know people in south america even when you don't speak their language.


## I like storms
On the way back from the island we were heading through a storm and right at the moment where my new mates taught me how to dance
samba, the first big weave was breaking on the foredeck. The feeling of the boat making is way through the waves reminded me
of sailing. It almost feels like being a viking fighting my way through the stormy sea.
