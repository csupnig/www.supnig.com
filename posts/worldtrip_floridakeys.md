We decided to rent a car and go all the way from Miami to Key West.

## Gettin' the 'stang ready
Patrik and I reserved our car on the day before and got up early to take it out right when the Avis shop opened on Monday. Preparing with
sunscreen and some breakfast, we set off from Miami to our 200 miles drive that should take us down to the southern most part of Florida.
It was my first drive in a convertible that took more then an hour and this was the perfect road for this car. The sun was shining down
on us and we had the ocean to both our left and our right side of the road. It took us about 4 hours to get to Key West and the first
thing we did was to go to the southern most point of the island. After a refreshing drink in a small french cafe, we headed to the beach
and checked out the colonial city with its cute little houses.

If you ever spend time in Florida, I urge you to take the time to drive down to Key West as the drive alone is worth it!
