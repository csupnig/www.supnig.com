Cointelligence is a free Bitcoin and Altcoin market analyzing tool, that helps you to find your trading strategy. With Cointelligence you are able to use your strategy for trades on our supported coin markets. The strategy is therefore executed on your browser and fed with the current market data.

We not only let traders test their strategies on past market data, but also support a live test, to verify the fitness of the selected strategy. The trader can then use the live trading feature to fully automate trades based on the selected strategy.

The Project is currently offline.
