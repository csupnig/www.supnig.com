Seems like the guys from Web Developer Conference picked my topic for their headline and so I'm going to talk on the 17th of september from 5pm to 6pm in Hamburg.

Last week I got an email that lightened my heart. My talk about enterprise search engines in web applications got accepted for the [Web Developer Conference](http://www.web-developer-conference.de/) that is taking place on the 17th and 18th of september at the SOFITEL in Hamburg.

There are going to be a lot of interesting talks and I'm looking forward to see you there!
