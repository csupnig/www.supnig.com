The thing with adventures is that things come differently than expected.

## I never stop learning
At the airport in Rio they did not let me board the plane that would first take me to Panama and then to San Jose. As it turnes out
you need a yellow fever shot when you travel from Brazil to Costa Rica. I did check before if you needed such a short for Brazil and
Costa Rica and you do not need it. But for some reason you do when you travel. Well I guess I never stop learning and just hope that
they will refund at least a part of what I payed for those flights.

## More time in Rio
So I guess that leaves me with some more days to spend in Rio and I definitely enjoyed the first one of those. When I came back to the
hostel that I stayed in with my cousins, I got to know Tina from Germany and Gita from the UK. We decided to go to the botanic garden
and check out Ipanema Beach again. And that was what we did!

Right now it feels like I will never get enough of Rio.
