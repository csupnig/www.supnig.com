![Aloha Editor Barcamp](/media/pictures/aloha-editor-barcamp-june-2013-small.png)On June 6 and 7 Gentics will be hosting the awesome Aloha Editor Barcamp in Vienna. You will get to meet lots of interesting people who were working on, with and around Aloha Editor and did all kinds of fancy projects with it. We will for example here about an integration into an online learning tool where the team built their custom UI on top of the Aloha Editor core. We will also see some fancy side projects that, for example, will let you edit ebooks online with Aloha Editor and Github or integrate Aloha Editor with AngularJS. On top of that you will have your very own chance to prepare and give a talk or workshop on a topic you are interested in and acquire feedback from an expert crowd.
