Visiting "The City".
<!--more-->
## The beautiful city of the weird
When the plane circled over the bay before landing in San Francisco, I could already see the hills and the golden gate bridge. It seemed
like from a book that tells a story about the early days of mountain biking or street skating. The typical american street grid makes it
almost impossible to get lost and enables one to see quite far. The weather is a bit chilly though and you should prepare for some strong
winds, especially when you go up one of the hills or visit the Golden Gate Bridge. Most of the people there are very nice and helpful, but
when the sun sets, a lot of drug addicts come out and roam the streets like zombies. It happened not only once that one of them would start
to scream at our group for a reason that will probably never be clear to us. I saw a lot of things and the city kept surprising me almost
every day.

## Keep it nice and artsy
One evening a girl from Brazil took us to a story telling contest, that was organized by some locals that were around since the beginning
of burning man festival. We had a lot of fun, listening to the stories of pranks and mischief on April 1st. If you happen to visit San
Francisco, you should definitely check them out [http://www.firesidestorytelling.com/](http://www.firesidestorytelling.com/). There were
also a lot of young musicians playing at the piers. Sitting there in the sun and listening to them, while the sea gulls were dancing in the
wind was very relaxing.

I met a lot of great people in "The City" and I hope to see all of you again!
