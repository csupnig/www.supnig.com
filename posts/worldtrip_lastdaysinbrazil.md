My time in Brazil is comming to an end and I am spending my last days in Maceio and on the way back to Salvador.

## Pontal de Coruripe
Philippe and me spent two nights in a small hostel in the middle of the city that offered cheap rooms and a decent breakfast.
The little village itself is located on the tip of a headland that was surrounded by a small riff. Protecting the sandy beach
from the weaves it also made for some very nice pictures as the water splashed against it. The beach seemed to be endless and
so we walked for an hour into one direction until we found a very nice spot to make a rest. When we woke up again, a few cows
strolled past us. Yes, that is right... cows on the beach!

## Maceio
On the second day the owner of the small hostel offered to bring us into the city of Coruripe where we cought our bus to Maceio,
which is apparently one of the most dangerous cities in Brazil. Again we only found nice people there. The hostel in Maceio was
located almost next to the beach and had rooms named after a lot of different countries. I was almost a bit shocked, when we were
placed in the room named "Austria". Our roommates for the night, a guy from argentina and a brazilero named Marcus were almost as
lazy as us but quite talkative. Marcus even joined us for a few drinks and dinner on the beach, where he told us about his work
for the government.
On the next day we were enjoying our last time on a brazilian beach and then took the night bus back to Salvador, where we arrived
10 hours later at 04:30 am.

## Leaving Brazil
Now I am sitting on the airport in Salvador en route to San Jose, Costa Rica and my time in Brazil comes to an end. I feel almost
a bit sad, leaving this nice and open country and I am sure that I will be back one time. This is also the time where Philippe has
to go back home and I will continue my trip alone.

Thanks for the nice time and hope to see you again soon!
