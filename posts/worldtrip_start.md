Now it is just little over a month until I will set sail into my greatest adventure so far.

## Why am I doing this?
I had this thought pattern, that I would tell myself that I just have to wait this time span X and then everything would start to come together. It was paralyzing
to a certain extent where I would constantly fall back into this circle of waiting instead of taking action. When friends would tell
me to start something with them or I was unsatisfied with the current situation I would just fall back into this waiting state.

Just a little over a year ago I wanted to break out of this circle and take action. That was when I first went to my company
and told them that I would not be available for a good part of 2015 and so my preparations began.

You certainly noticed that this preparations took place more on the inside rather than on paper as I wanted to change my mindset
about a few things before I went on this journey. I have not been to fond of social interaction and always tried to keep my distance
to people and it would always feel kind of awkward for me in big crowds. This had to change and I pushed and still keep pushing myself
to embrace social interaction and get all the good things out of it. Over the course of learning to interact I got to know a few very
interesting people who taught me how to listen to myself and be myself in order to become comfortable with social interactions.

I think that for me this world trip is the ultimate test for my new found confidence and I am absolutely looking forward to experience
many different cultures, cities and people.

## First destination
My first plane tickets are booked to Salvador, Brasil, where I will meet up with my dad, cousins and my uncle to spend an awesome
time in my uncles cafe [Café Ba-Cana](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Caf%C3%A9-Ba-Cana-Bar-e-Restaurante/257241011024106?pnref=lhc).
From there on I will continue alone northwards to find the adventures that are to come.
