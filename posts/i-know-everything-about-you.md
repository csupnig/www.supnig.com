Bob was heading to his favorite bar the other day when a man approached him and said: ?Hey Bob, how is Carla doing???Do I know you? And how come you know my wife?? Bob replied. ?It's me. Mike! Our friend Tom told me, you went to London last weekend??The conversation went on for quite some time until bob almost believed that this man was his buddy from high school. What Bob did not know, was that this man did not actually know him. He got all this information from Bob's facebook page. (A little rant about privacy)

Bob was heading to his
favorite bar the other day when a man approached him and said: "Hey
Bob, how is Carla doing?" "Do I know you? And how come you know my
wife?" Bob replied. "It's me. Mike! Our friend Tom told me, you
went to London last weekend?"The conversation went on for quite
some time until bob almost believed that this man was his buddy from
high school. What Bob did not know, was that this man did not
actually know him. He got all this information from Bob's facebook
page.

I agree that Bob is a bit
naive and that this story was made up. But it is almost frightening
how much private information people post on the internet. With
facebook, twitter, foursquare and all those other little apps we use
daily, we have become used to sharing information. Information, we
otherwise might not tell more than a few friends, let alone more than
a hundred people. 

I get that privacy
settings in most social applications can be a bit tricky and some
users might not even know what kind of information they are giving
away. Do you?

I know a lot of people
that are protesting against giving up their privacy to the government
by going  on the streets against INDECT and other fancy government
ideas that headed our way. But in the next moment they are checking
in on foursquare, letting everyone know where they are.

The other day a read this
post about ["Girls
Around Me"](http://www.cultofmac.com/157641/this-creepy-app-isnt-just-stalking-women-without-their-knowledge-its-a-wake-up-call-about-facebook-privacy/), an app, that lets you find... well... girls around
you. All this by just accessing your geo-location and the API of
facebook and foursquare. A nice bit of software that bluntly shows
what information is out there.

Why do some many people
freely give up everything about them? Has the time come where privacy
is a value we don't need anymore? I want to your opinion!
