For some people spending time in the kitchen is upmost joy. Luckily I am one of them, but I understand that for some preparing
their food is a chore and should not take up a lot of time. This is why I want to share my simplest recipes for everyone to
try at home.

## Cooking is the most important ingredient for a healthy life
For some people spending time in the kitchen is upmost joy. Luckily I am one of them, but I understand that for some preparing
their food is a chore and should not take up a lot of time. I believe that cooking and healthy food is a key ingredient for
a being productive and successful. This is why I want to share my simplest recipes for everyone to try at home.

Check out my fresh channel at [Cooking with a pirate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCON5375XLN4dVVF6rED0fmQ).

Here are my first videos for you to check out:

In a few of my upcoming videos I will invite interesting characters, who I met during my pirate adventures. They will bring
tasty recipes, interesting topics to discuss and a little spice to the table.

If you have some simple recipes that you would like to share or want to take part in one of the sessions,
just let me know and maybe you will be one of the next spots marked with an "X" on the pirate treasure map.

Feedback is much appreciated.
