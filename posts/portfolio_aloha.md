Aloha Editor is the WYSIWYG editor, that will let you seamlessly integrate a great editing experience in your web application.

Aloha abstracts the browsers functionality away from the developer and lets you care about building great applications instead
of fixing browser and contenteditable bugs. It uses a revolutionary data structure to work with the changes that are made to
your content.
