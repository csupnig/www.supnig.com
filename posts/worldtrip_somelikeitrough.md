A short story from rough trees, bumpy roads and giant centipede sex.

## Some like it rough
It already amazed me on the first day, how the condition of the local connections between the cities in Brazil does not seem
to bother people very much. Most of the streets I have seen were just dirt roads that recreated themselves every time water
starts pouring from the sky, and that happened almost every night. Local drivers still use the roads as if they where a closed
off race track and so the rides in those cars that take you around are pretty bumpy. It is a mixture of excitement and the question
if I will survive the next car ride and I have to say, I really grew fond of these tours. When we were visiting the Inacio the other
day, which is a big rock with a flat top that almost looks like a table, we again had one of those rides, that took us through the
country surrounding Palmeiras. We visited a 27km long cave and got to swim in one of the clearest pools of water in the area.
