**Role:** Technical project lead (Gentics), requirements engineering and developer

**Technology:** AngularJS, Java, JSR-286, Portlets, Apache Lucene, Apache Velocity, Oracle Database

With a user count of over 44k and over 100.000 central contents that can be customized and extended
by each of the 60 branches, the social intranet of the Erste Group was one of my bigger projects.
Together with the s IT Solutions, the in-house IT service provider of the Erste Group, we optimized 
for usability and performance.

Wikis, Blogs, direct editing of contents in the portal and a portal wide search are only a few of the
exciting features of the social intranet, which provides all the information for the daily work of 
Erste Group's employees.
